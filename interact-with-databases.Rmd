# Introduction

A database is an electronically stored collection of data. Typically
large amount of data lives inside a database, and it is often important
to know how to extract the right information. One type of database is
called **relational database**, in which several tables, consisting of
rows and columns (e.g. data frame), are related to one another.

To connect to and interact with databases, you have to install
appropriate system and software and make **SQL** (Structured Query
Language) queries to the database, which can be time consuming
especially if you don't already know SQL. In this workshop, I will show
you how to connect to a database using R, and how you can make queries
without having to directly write SQL.

# Connecting to a Database with DBI

First you will need to connect to the database, which is done with
`DBI::dbConnect()`.

The first argument is always the backend. The backend depends on what
your *Database Management System* (DBMS). DBMS is the software system
that the database uses to perform operations. DBMS for relational
database is called *Relational Database Management System* (RDBMS).
Examples of RDBMS include Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and
SQLite. Separate R Package exists for each of these RDBMS, so all you
need to do is figure out what RDBMS your database uses and find the
right package.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# If these packages don't exist, then you will get an error
# for PostgreSQL
?RPostgres::Postgres
# for MariaDB
?RMariaDB::MariaDB
```

In most cases, the database doesn't exist in a local file (as in within
your compuater), but in another server, which means you will be remotely
querying. In these cases, you will often need to input `host`, which is
the address of the database, `user`, and `password`.

For example, connecting to a PostgreSQL database server would look
something like:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
con <- DBI::dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres(), 
  host = "database-host", # address of the database
  user = "jshlee", # username
  password = rstudioapi::askForPassword("Database password") # password
)
```

You should **never** hard code your password into a script for security
purposes.
[Posit](https://solutions.posit.co/connections/db/best-practices/managing-credentials/)
suggests some practices to securely store and use your credentials

For this workshop, we will use SQLite because it is simple and
straightforward to use - there is no need to set up a separate database
server, which is great for demonstration!

```{r}
con <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = "data/sqlite-sakila.db")

con
```

For this workshop, we will use a **sakila** sample database. This is a
sample database developed in
[MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/) for documentation and
examples/tutorials/articles. This database represents an imaginary DVD
rental store, in which customers rent DVDs of different films from
multiple stores. It also contains information about films, actors,
transaction id, customer, etc.

The following image shows relationship between tables in the sakila
database.

This is called an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), which illustrates
how entities (in this case, table) relate to one another.

# Database overview with DBI

Let's start by checking available table using `dbListTables`.

```{r}
con %>% dbListTables()
```

To check column names of a table in the database, use `dbListFields`.

```{r}
con %>% dbListFields(name = "actor")
```

You can read a database table to a data frame using `dbReadTable`

```{r}
con %>% dbReadTable("actor") %>% tibble()
```

If you already know some SQL, you can also directly make SQL queries
with `dbSendQuery()`

```{r}
# select all actors where first name starts with P
stmt <- "SELECT * FROM actor WHERE first_name LIKE 'P%';"
res <- dbGetQuery(con, stmt)
res
```

## Exercise 1

Let's review some of the concepts we just learned.

List all the tables in the database

```{r}

```

List all columns in the `city` table

```{r}

```

From the `city` table, retrieve cities with `country_id = 103`.

**Note** You can do this two ways - by directly reading to a data frame,
or using SQL query. Don't worry if you don't know SQL! SQL syntax is not
the scope of this workshop, and we will soon learn a powerful feature of
`dplyr` that lets us query from the database without explicitly writing
SQL!

```{r}

```

# Making Queries with dplyr

If you are familiar with `tidyverse` framework, you're probably also
familiar with the `dplyr` verbs. `dplyr` provides a set of tools that
help you with common data manipulation problems. The verbs and functions
from `dplyr` can also be used on database connections, relieving you of
the responsibility of generating your own SQL queries!

This is possible because `dplyr` has different backends that drive the
functions. The type of backend used depends on the kind of data you are
working with. For database systems,
[`dbplyr`](https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/) works as a backend. This
allows you to use the database tables as if they are data frames
residing in your memory. Behind the scenes, it automatically converts
the dplyr code into SQL.

In general, there are three parts to working with database using
`dplyr`:

-   create database table object with `tbl()`
-   generate query
-   retrieve data with `collect()`

Let's first create an object that represents a database table

```{r}
actor <- tbl(con, "actor")
actor
```

It looks like a regular tibble, but you can see from the top that is a
table from a SQLite database.

If you try indexing like you would with a regular data frame or a
tibble, you will get an error

```{r error=TRUE}
actor[1,]
```

To retrieve the data, you will need to run `collect()` on it

```{r}
actor <- collect(actor)
actor
```

## Selecting columns

You can select columns to extract using \`select()

```{r}
film_tbl <- tbl(con, "film")

film <- film_tbl %>%
  select(title, release_year, length, rating) %>%
  collect()

head(film)
```

## Rename Columns

You can also rename the columns

```{r}
film <- film_tbl %>%
  select(title, release_year, length, rating) %>%
  rename(year = release_year) %>%
  collect()

head(film)
```

## Filter Observations

`filter()` filters observations.

```{r}
long_films <- film_tbl %>%
  select(title, release_year, length, rating) %>%
  rename(year = release_year) %>%
  filter(length > 180 & year == "2006") %>%
  collect()
```

## Show Query

When I was introducing `dbplyr` I mentioned that it translate from
`dplyr` verbs into SQL. `show_query()` displays the query generated.
This is useful when you are trying to debug your code or if you're
learning SQL!

```{r}
# notice how I haven't run collect() yet
long_films_query <- film_tbl %>%
  select(title, release_year, length, rating) %>%
  rename(year = release_year) %>%
  filter(length > 180 & year == "2006")

# generate SQL query
long_films_query %>% show_query()
```

### Exercise 2

Using `dplyr` (with `dbplyr` backend), retrieve a list of film where
`replacement_cost` is over 20 and rating is `R`. Get columns `title`,
`description`, `rental_duration`, `special_features`,
`replacement_cost`, and `rating`.

```{r}

```

BONUS

If you have time, try to figure out why I used `"2006"` to filter year
instead of doing `2006`. If I do `2006`, no rows are retrieved. (Hint:
`2006L` also works)

```{r}
film_tbl %>%
  select(title, release_year, length, rating) %>%
  rename(year = release_year) %>%
  filter(length > 180 & year == 2006) %>%
  collect()
```

## Order by Column

Use `arrange()` to order by column(s).

```{r}
film_tbl %>%
  select(title, release_year, length, rating) %>%
  rename(year = release_year) %>%
  filter(length > 180 & year == "2006") %>%
  arrange(length, desc(rating)) %>%
  collect()
```

## Group Observations

Use `group_by()` to group observations, and use `summarize()` calculate
a summary statistic and select columns.

For example, let's look at top 5 customer paid the most for rental using
`payment` table.

```{r}
payment_tbl <- tbl(con, "payment")
payment_tbl

payment_tbl %>%
  group_by(customer_id) %>%
  summarize(
    amount_sum = sum(amount),
    num_rental = count()
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(amount_sum)) %>% 
  head(5) %>%
  collect()
```

## Joining Tables

Joins can also be done in `dplyr` syntax.

Suppose I want to identify films that generated the most amount of money
through rental.

Lets look at following tables.

```{r}
rental_tbl <- tbl(con, "rental")
inventory_tbl <- tbl(con, "inventory")
```

`payment` table:

```{r}
payment_tbl
```

`rental` table:

```{r}
rental_tbl
```

`inventory` table:

```{r}
inventory_tbl
```

The `payment` table has `rental_id` column, but this column doesn't tell
me which film was rented since this is an id for the transaction that
took place.

To identify the film, we need to get the `inventory_id` of the
corresponding transaction from `rental` table and map that to `film_id`
in the `inventory` table.

Let's first join `rental` and `inventory` table

```{r}
rental_to_film_tbl <- rental_tbl %>%
  select(rental_id, inventory_id) %>%
  left_join(
    inventory_tbl %>%
      select(inventory_id, film_id)
    , by = "inventory_id"
  )
rental_to_film_tbl
```

I'm not using `collect()` just yet because I'm using this to join back
into payment table

```{r}
payment_film_tbl <- payment_tbl %>%
  left_join(
    rental_to_film_tbl,
    by = "rental_id"
    ) %>%
  select(rental_id, film_id, amount)
payment_film_tbl
```

Now we have a table that shows which film wasa rented for how much.
Finally, we can group by film and identify the most successful film.

```{r}
payment_film_tbl %>%
  group_by(film_id) %>%
  summarise(total_amount = sum(amount)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_amount)) %>%
  collect() %>%
  head(10)
  
```

### Exercise 3

The following code retrieves a table that records total rental amount
from each film id. This is the same table from the previous
demonstration minus the ordering and collecting stage.

Unfortunately, it still doesn't tell us much about what the films really
are. Can you use join to retrieve the title and description of these
films, and show the top 10 results?

```{r}
payment_tbl <- tbl(con, "payment")
rental_tbl <- tbl(con, "rental")
inventory_tbl <- tbl(con, "inventory")

rental_to_film_tbl <- rental_tbl %>%
  select(rental_id, inventory_id) %>%
  left_join(
    inventory_tbl %>%
      select(inventory_id, film_id)
    , by = "inventory_id"
  )
payment_film_tbl <- payment_tbl %>%
  left_join(
    rental_to_film_tbl,
    by = "rental_id"
    ) %>%
  select(rental_id, film_id, amount)
top_films_tbl <- payment_film_tbl %>%
  group_by(film_id) %>%
  summarise(total_amount = sum(amount))

top_films_tbl
```

```{r}

```

## Conclusion

In this workshop you learned how to connect to and interact with a
database within R environment with tidyverse framework. This is a very
valuable tool since it allows us to transform and extract information
from databases without having to constantly switch back and forth
between thinking in R and in SQL. You can make different types of
queries just by using `dplyr` verbs, which also helps with maintaining
easily understandable code.

To learn more about dbplyr and its features, I recommend you visit the
[package webpage](https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/), and [this
section](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/databases) in **R for Data Science**
book.

As your query becomes more complex, you inevitably run into unexpected
bugs and errors. In these cases, it is helpful to know SQL since you'll
be using `show_query()` to retrieve the actual query being made and
understand what needs to be fixed. We have previously offered workshop
in [SQL](https://github.com/nuitrcs/intro_to_SQL), so I encourage you to
check it out!
